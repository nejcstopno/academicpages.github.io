I am a microbial ecologist with research focus on microbial interactions and how these interactions influence community and ecosystem functioning. To do so, I am using a combination of field and lab studies, implementing -omics and culture-based techniques.  

My research is driven by the following questions:
* How do functional redundant microbial species coexist in the environment?
* What are the molecular and genetic mechanisms controlling host-bacteria interactions?
* What is the ecological role of the most abundant soil microbes?

Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the Michigan State University (MSU) working in the group of [Ashley Shade](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/people/faculty/shade-ashley/). I joined the Shade lab in April 2017 to establish plant-microbe interaction studies using common bean and bioenergy crops (switchgrass and miscanthus) as model systems. These studies are linked to the [Plant Resilience Institute](https://plantresilience.msu.edu/) at the MSU and [Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center](https://www.glbrc.org/) (GLBRC). Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the lab of [David Stahl](https://www.ce.washington.edu/people/faculty/stahld) at the University of Washington where I was investigating the ecology and evolution of syntrophic interactions using synthetic microbial ecology approach. The work was done through collaboration within [ENIGMA](http://enigma.lbl.gov/) research consortium.
