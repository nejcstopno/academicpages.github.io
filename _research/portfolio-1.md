The common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.) is the primary grain legume for human consumption and it represents a rich source of protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, especially in the developing nations of Africa and Latin America. However, yield estimates and production areas for common bean are predicted to decrease in this century due to the impacts of global change. One possibility for improving common bean resistance to global changes is to harness beneficial members of its microbiome, but there are many unknowns concerning the major biotic and abiotic factors shaping bean microbiota under relevant field conditions. 
Thus we initiated 3 projects to improve our understanding of common bean microbiome:
* __Assessing the core rhizosphere microbiota of the common bean__
* __Describing the succession of common bean microbiota during plant development__ 
	* succession on 3 different plant compartments - rhizosphere, endosphere (roots and leaves), phyllosphere 
	* functional changes related to plant development and the role of plant exudates
* __Comparing the symbiotic nitrogen fixation abilities in wild and domesticated common bean; does _Rhizobium_ diversity matter?__
Methods: amplicon sequencing, GeoChip, qPCR, metagenomics, mass spectrometry, soil enzyme activities, soil respiration rates (SoilResp)
