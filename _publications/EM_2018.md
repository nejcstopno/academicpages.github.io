Most agricultural N2O emissions are a consequence of microbial transformations of nitrogen (N) fertilizer, and mitigating increases in N2O emission will depend on identifying microbial sources and variables influencing their activities. Here, using controlled microcosm and field studies, we found that synthetic N addition in any tested amount stimulated the production of N2O from ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria (AOB), but not archaea (AOA), from a bioenergy crop soil.
